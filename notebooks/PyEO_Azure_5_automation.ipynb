    "# Automating a processing chain using Python apps (scripts)\n",
    "So far, we have run Jupyter Notebooks to go through the steps involved in the creation of a baseline image composite, the downloading and processing of change detection images, the classification into land cover maps, the change detection and verification, and the aggregation of many change maps into one report image file. We have then vectorised the report image to reduce its file size and emailed the reports to registered users as an email attachment.\n",
    "This notebook shows how we can build an efficient and more automated forest alerts processing chain. We will do this by basically turning the four previous notebooks into Python scripts (also sometimes called Apps). A Python script ends with .py and is executable from within Python."
